## Overview

Employee engagement plays a critical role in organizational productivity, retention, and performance—especially in logistics and operations-driven industries.  
This project uses **machine learning ensemble techniques** to predict employee engagement levels based on workplace, performance, and personal factors.

A **Hybrid Voting Classifier** combining **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** is implemented to achieve high accuracy and reliability.
